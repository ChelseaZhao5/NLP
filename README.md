Course Project

The main goal of this project is to build classification model to predict the polarities of movie reviews. The dataset contains one feature only, which the texts of submitted reviews. The dataset also includes polarity, which is the label to be used to build supervised machine learning model.

Steps I took:

1. Build a pipeline to process text, including tranforming all words to lower cases, removing numbers, lemmatization, and etc.

2. Applied Bag of Words and TF-IDF transformation to create features for the most informative text

3. Build classification model and assess model performance
